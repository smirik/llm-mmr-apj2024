    "The opposite situation is when the resonant angle circulates. It means that the curve is not limited and can reach the borders of the plot. In our case, if the resonant angle is greater than pi or less than -pi, then we add or substract 2pi to the resonant angle to make it within the limits. Therefore, in the case of circulation, the pattern will be like linear curves parallel each other.\n",
