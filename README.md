# LLM in astronomy: an example

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook with the experiment that aims to demonstrate that one can use LLMs to resolve astronomical problems.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `mmr-example.ipynb`.
3. Replace `api_key` with your OpenAI's key.

Now you can run the simulation.

If you want to perform classification of other asteroids, just replace the lists `r_bodies`, `t_bodies`, and `n_bodies`.

You can easily reuse this notebook for other tasks. In this case, it is necessary to update the prompt used.
